Product Narrative

The Problem
Graduate students face a constant struggle to balance affordability, nutrition, and time when it comes to meal planning. With the rising cost of living, students frequently overspend on food, often exceeding their budgets by $25-$50 per week. Traditional meal planning is time-consuming, and existing solutions fail to integrate real-time grocery cost tracking, making it difficult for students to optimize their spending.
The lack of financial and nutritional awareness in meal planning leads to over $2.1 billion in unnecessary spending annually across U.S. graduate students. This financial burden is coupled with the inconvenience of manually tracking meal expenses and shopping lists, resulting in wasted time, suboptimal meal choices, and unhealthy eating habits.
Students need a simple, automated way to plan meals efficiently while ensuring they stay within budget and meet their dietary needs. Current solutions like Mealime and PlateJoy provide meal-planning features, but they do not address the growing need for cost-conscious meal optimization. Without a way to link meal plans to real-time grocery prices, students continue to overspend and struggle with planning balanced meals.

The Solution
MealWise is a smart, budget-conscious meal planning app that empowers graduate students to make healthier, cost-effective food choices effortlessly. Unlike existing apps, MealWise integrates real-time grocery pricing data, allowing users to create optimized meal plans that fit their budget while meeting nutritional goals.
With MealWise, students can:
•	Plan affordable meals in minutes using an AI-driven meal recommendation engine.
•	Track grocery prices in real-time, ensuring they stay within budget.
•	Receive personalized nutrition insights based on dietary preferences.
•	Generate grocery lists instantly and compare store prices for the best deals.
•	Seamlessly integrate with Google Calendar, allowing users to schedule meal prep efficiently.

How It Works
MealWise is designed with a simple, intuitive workflow:
1.	Users enter dietary preferences (eg - vegetarian, high-protein, gluten-free) and budget constraints.
2.	AI generates meal plans that optimize cost and nutritional balance.
3.	Grocery price tracking ensures students get the best deals by integrating local store pricing.
4.	Users receive a customized shopping list with cost estimates, helping them make informed decisions.
5.	MealWise syncs with calendars, allowing students to allocate time for meal preparation efficiently.
With MealWise, students can save up to $2,600 annually, reducing food waste and improving their overall meal planning experience.

The Value
MealWise offers a high-impact solution by addressing the three major challenges faced by graduate students:
•	Affordability: Saves students $25-$50 per week by integrating real-time grocery pricing.
•	Time Efficiency: Reduces meal planning to under 5 minutes per week.
•	Health & Nutrition: Ensures at least 80% of meals meet USDA dietary guidelines.
For Students:
•	A smarter, automated way to plan meals within their budget.
•	Access to real-time grocery prices, eliminating overspending.
•	Personalized nutrition tracking, ensuring balanced meals.

For the Market:
•	Unique Differentiation: No existing competitor combines meal planning with grocery price tracking.
•	Scalability: The segmented pricing model allows MealWise to serve both budget-conscious students and health-focused users.
•	Competitive Advantage: Competitors like Mealime and PlateJoy focus solely on meal planning, missing the opportunity to optimize grocery expenses.

Market Opportunity
The Total Addressable Market (TAM) for MealWise includes the 3.3 million graduate students in the U.S.
•	Monetary TAM: $158 million annually (assuming a $7.99/month subscription for 50% of students).
•	Premium Adoption Potential: If 30% of users upgrade to the premium plan ($12.99/month), TAM increases to $180 million annually.
MealWise capitalizes on the shift toward digital-first meal planning and budget optimization, ensuring a strong value proposition in the growing student finance and health-conscious markets.

Justification & Competitive Edge
Why will students choose MealWise?
•	Immediate Cost Savings: Users save 4x-10x the monthly subscription fee through optimized grocery shopping.
•	Personalized Experience: AI adapts meal plans based on evolving preferences and budget constraints.
•	Ease of Adoption: A freemium model ensures risk-free adoption, with premium features available for those seeking advanced insights.

Unlike competitors, MealWise is built on the understanding that students need more than just a meal plan—they need a cost-efficient strategy to manage their nutrition.




Conclusion
MealWise is more than just a meal-planning app—it is a smart, budget-conscious food optimization tool for graduate students. By integrating grocery price tracking with AI-driven meal planning, it fills a critical gap in the market, providing users with tangible financial savings, health benefits, and time efficiency.

4. Outcomes
1.	Outcome 1: Meals are affordable
Actual Outcome Statement: The average weekly food expense for graduate students is $75-$100.
Desired Outcome Statement: The average weekly food expense for graduate students is less than $50.
Metric: Average weekly food expenses (in USD).
Measurement Method: Track and sum total weekly grocery and dining expenses through receipts, bank statements, or a budgeting app.

2.	Outcome 2: Maintain a balanced diet
Actual Outcome Statement: 40% of graduate student meals meet basic nutritional requirements.
Desired Outcome Statement: At least 80% of graduate student meals meet basic nutritional requirements.
Metric: Percentage of meals meeting basic nutritional requirements (e.g., USDA guidelines)
Measurement Method: Use nutritional analysis tools or apps to assess recipes and meals against USDA dietary guidelines, tracking over a week.

3.	Outcome 3: Meals are prepared in a short period of time
Actual Outcome Statement: The average preparation time per meal is 45 minutes.
Desired Outcome Statement: The average preparation time per meal is 20 minutes or less.
Metric: Average preparation time per meal (in minutes).
Measurement Method: Track and record preparation times for meals using a timer or self-reports over one week.


5. Problem

a.	Gap
On average, the actual graduate students' weekly food expenses is $25–$50 higher than the desired budget of $50.


b.	Causes
a.	Lack of Meal Planning Skills: Inability to plan efficient, cost-effective meals leads to overspending and food waste.
b.	Reliance on Eating Out: Limited cooking skills or time constraints push students to eat out or rely on pre-packaged meals, which are significantly more expensive than cooking at home.
c.	Unawareness of Cost-Effective Options: Students lack knowledge about affordable grocery stores, discounts, or meal-prep techniques, resulting in higher-than-necessary expenses.

8. Problem Sizing
Per Instance Problem Size
If a student meal-plans once per week, the overspending per instance is $25–$50 per week.
Graduate students meal-plan every week, so the total annual overspending is: 
$25–$50 per week × 52 weeks = $1,300 – $2,600 per year.

Number of Graduate Students in the U.S.: ~3.3 million (based on National Center for Education Statistics data).

Assuming 50% of graduate students struggle with meal budgeting, the affected population is: ~1.65 million students.

Per student:
•	$1,300 – $2,600 in overspending annually.
Total for affected students (~1.65M students in the U.S.):
•	$2.1B – $4.3B in overspending per year.

9. Problem Category
Meal Planning Efficiency problem

10. Problem Statement
Graduate students experience an average of $25–$50 more in weekly food expenses than their desired budget, because inefficient meal planning and lack of cost-effective grocery strategies lead to overspending and food waste. This results in an annual financial burden of $1,300–$2,600 per student, with a cumulative impact of over $4 billion annually across affected students in the U.S. Addressing this problem will reduce weekly food expenses to align with the desired budget and ensure affordable, balanced nutrition.
